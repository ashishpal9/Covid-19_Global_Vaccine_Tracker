The main goal was to provide insights on the vaccination rollout at a global scale.
I decided to implement my idea in PowerBI as it's one of the most popular and powerful data visualisation softwares.Implementation.I decided to implement my idea in PowerBI as it's one 
of the most popular and powerful data visualisation softwares.After exploration of several data sets, I decided to utilise the Our World in Data COVID vaccination dataset, 
which is updated regularly and it uses the most recent official numbers from governments and health ministries worldwide.


Key metrics displayed in the dashboard include:

i) share of the population that has been partly or fully vaccinated
ii) vaccine doses administred daily
iii) boosters administered daily
iv) GDP correlation with vaccination program performance


The dashboard allows filtering by Location and it includes cool map charts too.
